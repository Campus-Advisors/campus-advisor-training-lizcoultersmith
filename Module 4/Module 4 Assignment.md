# Module 4 Assignment

Please answer the following questions on the GitHub Education Community forum here:

1. Describe the existing technical student communities on your campus. Who is served? Where are there gaps?
We currently have a Computing Society with around 200 members on campus. This serves all Computing students in all three undergrad years plus MSc/PhD students. We have a range of activities including hackathons and group field trips. Communication is always tricky so there's a gap there, also some students prefer a more solitary activity and there is an assumption that group activities are the only way to participate. I started a few Discord servers for my modules and at least this gives these students some sense of community but there is certainly more that could be done.


2. Choose one GitHub Education program. How could it support your on-campus student communities?
Having some swag would be a great start! I will certainly let students know about the internships and other ways that they can be supported by GitHub. We start the year off learning the basics and getting them to sign up for the GitHub Student Pack. This is our second year of integrating GitHub into the classroom in Web Development from day one! Some swag for class challenges would be great!

3. What would you need to do in order to support the growth of student tech communities on campus?

Work more closely with the Computing Society to see what's possible and what they would like to engage with.
